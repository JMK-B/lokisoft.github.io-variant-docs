A Variant Application

A Variant application is made from configuration files, Code / YAML files, a Host  Runtime and extensions, or API applications. 


Endpoints:
Endpoints are not called directly by the runtime but handled by the host runtime providing a HttpConnector endpoint and then by a WebApi strategy. This strategy contains has hooks to all  the endpoints in the application and then, depennding on the URL and Method type, calls the correct endpoint pipeline.
