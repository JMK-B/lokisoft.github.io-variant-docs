# Programming concepts

Like all programming languages Unite's YAML development language is built from 5 core concepts:

- **State**: This is the stored information that is passed through the application from any request or event.
- **Execution flow**: This is the order in which instructions occur and are processed.
- **Conditional flow**: This determines which path a program takes, or is available, when it is running.
- **Iteration**: Iteration is the repeated execution of a section of code when a program is running.
- **Exception handling**: This is how your handles any errors or exceptions that arise when the application is running.

> Note the above concepts mentioned in this article relate specifically to the YAML language itself and not the runtime / application in which the YAML is compiled and run in.
