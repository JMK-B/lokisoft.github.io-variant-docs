The Unite server platform is a YAML configuration based integration platform as a service (iPaaS). Unlike any other iPaaS the Unite Server Platform was built using the Unite Server platform.

- iPaaS
- built using itself
- Benefits
  - Automation
  - Reuse at every level. Generic strategies, pipes & connectors. The more you use it the quicker development will be.
  - All applications are run on your servers under your control(when not self hosted)
  - Includes testing suite that allows integration and unit tests to be done.
  - Text YAML based with full word completion.
  - All be done through a browser
  - Can be extended easily to allow core domain code to be run within the framework through extensions packages are built using only YAML. e.g.
  - Most API based extension packages are YAML only without the need for DLL hell.
  - Hides complexities of traditional code e.g. async
  - Junior developer or anybody with basic scripting knowledge
  - Continuous developpment - add new apis or listeners without recompalation
  - all services created are run and debuigger in the cloud
  - Each application provides a framework that includes:
    - logging and instrumentation
    - deployments
    - Secrets and app settings
    - Apps can be hosted in either Azure functions or in containers. You can change from one to another within 30 seconds.

- writer (cannot uopdate vaults ) NOPE!!!! KISS!!!!!!

Built from the ground up with automation and reuse at every point of the devlopement being

Goals.
If we take a general view of As a genberal rule about 5% of any project should be core domain focused

## What is it (tool for creating all types of applications)

## Goals
