The Unite server platform is a YAML configuration based integration platform as a service (iPaaS). Its online development environment allows users to create all types of backend services without the need for a local development environment.

###  Benefits of the platform
* Online text based development platform
* All applications created are run on your servers under your control (although hosting options are available)
* * Common structure to all types of applications allow an inbuilt and common approach and inbuilt functionality for :
	* Instrumentation
	* Application settings
	* Secure settings
	* Deployments 
* Shared functionality and settings across or your services
* Inbuilt reuse framework  
* All applications are hosted as they would be in production. 
* Continuous development - See new or updated APIs,  listeners or code changes immediately in your running online service.
* Integrated testing suite
* You application is Host agnostic and runtimes for different hosts is managed through extension packages

The Unite server platform is a YAML configuration based integration platform as a service (iPaaS). Unlike any other iPaaS the Unite Server Platform was built using the Unite Server platform.

- iPaaS
- built using itself
- Benefits
  - Automation
  - Reuse at every level. Generic strategies, pipes & connectors. The more you use it the quicker development will be.
  - Includes testing suite that allows integration and unit tests to be done.
  - Text YAML based with full word completion.
  - All be done through a browser
  - Can be extended easily to allow core domain code to be run within the framework through extensions packages are built using only YAML. e.g.
  - Most API based extension packages are YAML only without the need for DLL hell.
  - Hides complexities of traditional code e.g. async
  - Junior developer or anybody with basic scripting knowledge
  - Continuous developpment - add new apis or listeners without recompalation
  - all services created are run and debuigger in the cloud
  - Each application provides a framework that includes:
    - logging and instrumentation
    - deployments
    - Secrets and app settings
    - Apps can be hosted in either Azure functions or in containers. You can change from one to another within 30 seconds.

Built from the ground up with automation and reuse at every point of the devlopement being

Goals.
If we take a general view of As a genberal rule about 5% of any project should be core domain focused

## What is it (tool for creating all types of applications)

## Goals
