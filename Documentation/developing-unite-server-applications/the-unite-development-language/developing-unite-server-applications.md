# Developing Unite Server applications

After reading this section the user should have a firm grasp of t      he concepts of Unite Server, the development and release process and an understanding on the Unite YAML development language.  The 4 main areas that will be covered are:

* *[Design principals](design-principals.md): This will introduce the user to the concepts of a Unite application and a brief look at some of the features.
* [The anatomy of a Unite Server application](the-anatomy-of-a-unite-server-application.md): Here we'll look at the file structure and constituent parts of a Unite Server application. This will include the core concepts of the YAML development language such as connectors, endpoints, pipes and strategies.
* [Specialisations and derivatives](specialisations-and-derivatives.md): This is the core feature of Unite that provides reuse capabilities and across all connectors, pipes and strategies.
* [unite-development-language](unite-development-language.md): This section provides a look at the syntax and workings of the  YAML development language and explains how to perform common programming tasks such as iteration, program flow, exceptions handling, substitutions, etc.

## The Unite YAML development language

Overview

Connectors, Endpoint, Pipes & Strategies

A Variant Application

A Variant application is made from configuration files, Code / YAML files, a Host  Runtime and extensions, or API applications. 


Endpoints:
Endpoints are not called directly by the runtime but handled by the host runtime providing a HttpConnector endpoint and then by a WebApi strategy. This strategy contains has hooks to all  the endpoints in the application and then, depennding on the URL and Method type, calls the correct endpoint pipeline. 



### Schema

### Programming concepts

    - Exception handling
    - Substitutions
    - foreach / iterations
    - Pipe execution
    - Grouped pipes
    - Specializations



## Extension packages

Overview

- primary / secondary
- Shared / subscription based

### Creating local YAML only extension packages

### Creating new Listenenrs, strategies,

API

## TEsting
