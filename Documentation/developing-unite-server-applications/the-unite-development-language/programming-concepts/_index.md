# Programming concepts

Like all programming languages Unite's YAML development language is built from 6 common core  concepts:

- [State:](state.md) This is the stored information that is passed through the application's pipelines from any request or event.
- [Conditional flow:](conditional-flow.md) This determines which path a program takes, or is available, when it is running.
- [Iteration:](iteration.md) Iteration is the repeated execution of a section of code when a program is running.
- [Exception handling](exception-handling.md): This is how your handles any errors or exceptions that arise when the application is running. 
- [Code blocks /  Grouped pipes:](grouped-pipes.md) This allows users to group a serieis of pipes into a single scoped pipe containing a pipeline. 

> Note the above concepts mentioned in this article relate specifically to the YAML language itself and not the runtime / application in which the YAML is compiled and run in.
