Mule apps in production environments typically use multiple flows and subflows to divide the app into functional modules or for [error-handling](https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/4.5/about-flows#error_handling) purposes. For example, one flow might receive a record and transform data into a given format that another flow processes in some special way.\n\nYou can connect and trigger their execution with [Flow Reference](https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/4.5/flowref-about) components or by using the DataWeave `lookup` function within expressions and transformations. The function passes the current event to another flow for further event processing. You can think of a Flow Reference as a function call that accepts an event as input and then returns the modified event."}
